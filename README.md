# Serial-LCD-ATmega32-
SPI Communication Protocol Interfacing with LCD (ATmega32)
- Features: Using SPI to send Commands and data to the LCD through Shift
Register(74HC595).
- Peripherals (DIO, SPI).

-Creating hardware connections and wiring diagrams to establish communication between microcontroller, shift register, and LCD. .
-Utilized a shift register( 74HC595) to efficiently transmit data from a microcontroller to the LCD display.
